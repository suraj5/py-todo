I've often found myself in need of a simple yet efficient task manager.  There are plenty of these sorts of apps to go around, but most of them have more features than I want or need.  Others are commercial/proprietary.  I decided to take it upon myself to make my own to suit my wants and needs.  I do not intend for this application to become a full-fledged project management suite by any means.  It shall remain very simple and hopefully efficient.

I figured it would be a great way to get more familiar with the language and ~~PyGTK~~ wxPython.  As such, it's very probable that some things are not done in the most efficient way.  I'm open to suggestions for ways to improve the code.

**Note**: This application is not yet functional.
